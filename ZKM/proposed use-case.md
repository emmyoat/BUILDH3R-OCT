### Proposed usecase using ZKM
Implementing smart contracts alongside ZKM's Entangled and Hybrid Rollups can transform quality assurance in the agricultural supply chain. By defining quality metrics—like pesticide levels and organic certification—within smart contracts, stakeholders can automate compliance checks using IoT devices that monitor these standards in real time. When quality metrics are met, transactions are automatically executed, facilitating smoother payments. Retailers gain access to verified quality data, enhancing consumer trust. This system not only streamlines operations, reducing manual checks and paperwork but also minimizes disputes by providing transparent, immutable data, ultimately leading to cost savings for all participants in the supply chain.
